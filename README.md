# Diabetics-Prediction
# Summary
The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# Problem Statement
The type of dataset and problem is a classic supervised binary classification.
Given a number of elements all with certain characteristics (features), we want to build a machine learning model to identify people affected by type 2 diabetes.

To solve the problem we will have to analyse the data, do any required transformation and normalisation, apply a machine learning algorithm, train a model, check the performance of the trained model and iterate with other algorithms until we find the most performant for our type of dataset.
# Columns in this Dataset
The dataset includes data from 768 women with 8 characteristics, in particular:

Number of times pregnant
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes pedigree function
Age (years)

# Python package used in this problem for prediction

# Sklearn
# Pandas
# Keras
